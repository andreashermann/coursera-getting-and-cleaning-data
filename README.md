## Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This repository contains the code for the Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data" course project.

Execute the script "Run_analysis.R" to perform the steps as described on the project website.

When loaded this script downloads the data and performs the following analysis:

1. Merge the training and test data sets
2. Extract the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities
4. Label the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. Export a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

As result it creates a file "tidy.data.txt" in your working directory.
